# Student Career Assist
**This project was created by Clarence Grimaldo, Faith Madukwe, Morgan Alger, and Griffin Mwangi. Created for the final of ITSC 3155, Software Engineering.**


This website provides career guidance for graduate students by keeping up with real-time job market trends, offering insights into in-demand skills, and recommending what skills they need to build to obtain a certain job in a certain field.

It would create a custom career roadmap, map out internship and job plans, and send reminders for application deadlines or career events. Additionally, the app would facilitate networking with peers and alumni through forums or groups based on shared interests, promoting collaboration and mentorship. It will also provide a tracking feature for required skills and qualifications that will help students stay on track with meeting job requirements and integrate with the schoolâ€™s academic system to align coursework with career goals.
